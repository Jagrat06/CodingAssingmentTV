Hi Team TestVagrant,
Below are the instruction to execute the TCs

###################################################################
# Execution can be done by ways 
# 1 Right click on Project and run as maven test
# 2 Open TestRunner Class, right click on the body and run as Junit
# 3 Right click on feature file named as "Assigment" and click on run
# 4 Can be run from commandline as well

#####################################################################

Note: I have used JAVA-SELENIUM-CUCUMBER to solve the problem statement
      There are total 13 TCs and 3 Sceanarios
      I have followed concept of POM, it can be ran be command line and the solution is almost generalized. 

THANK YOU,
Jagrat
